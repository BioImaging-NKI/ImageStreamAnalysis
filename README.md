# ImageStreamAnalysis
Scripts for the analysis of tumor-immune cell interactions in Imaging Flow Cytrometry data.

Note: These scripts are still under development. They will be finalized 'soon', together with detailed instructions on how to run them.

For combining exported ImageStream images into multipage tiff files, see our [ImageStreamCobiner repository](https://github.com/BioImaging-NKI/ImageStreamCombiner).
