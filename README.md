# ImageStream Analysis
Scripts for the analysis of tumor-immune cell interactions in Imaging Flow Cytrometry data.

**Note**: This GitHub site is currently mostly a placeholder. Instructions on how to run them will follow 'soon'.
The two `.ijm` Fiji macros currently have different functionalities, but will at some point be merged into a single script.

For combining exported ImageStream images into multipage tiff files, see our [ImageStreamCombiner repository](https://github.com/BioImaging-NKI/ImageStreamCombiner).
